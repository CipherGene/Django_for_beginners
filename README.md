# Django_for_beginners

The best Django tutorial seems to be the official Django Book itself based on lots of people's experience(including me):

http://www.djangobook.com/

But it's quite a little bit long with most of the details you need to know. There is another video tutorial from the Django authors on PyCon, which might be a good starting point:

Another first Django app tutorial:

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/tutorial01/

Finally, GitHub is a fantastic site to learn real Django code. You can simply search "Django" on respository to see how other people implementing all kinds of things, e.g. Django message board:
